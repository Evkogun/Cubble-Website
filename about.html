    <h1>About Cubble</h1>
    <i><p>Connecting people, not just profiles.</i></p>

<p>Cubble is redefining what it means to be social online. 
  We believe that real connections don’t come from endless scrolling or superficial likes but from meaningful conversations, authentic interactions, and the freedom to share without compromise.

  <section class="about-story">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Cubble was founded to rethink social networking - putting autheniticity and genuine connection at the center.</p>


    <p>Cubble started with a simple but powerful idea: social networking should bring people closer, not further apart. We were frustrated by platforms that prioritized algorithms over people, so we set out to build something different—a space where privacy, authenticity, and connection come first.</p>

      <p>What began as an idea has grown into a thriving global community. Every day, we’re inspired by the stories of people who use Cubble to connect with new friends, or to find the love of their life.</p>

      <li>We believe in creating <b>safe, supportive environments</b> where everyone feels welcome.</li>
