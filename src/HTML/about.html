      <h1>About Cubble</h1>
      <p></p><i>Connecting people, not just profiles.</i></p>

      <p> Cubble is reimagining what it means to be social online.
        We believe true connection isn’t built on endless scrolling or hollow likes, it’s built through real
        conversations, honest expression and the freedom to be yourself.</p>

    <section class="about-story">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Cubble was born from something deeply personal: loneliness.</p>

      <p>Jessica Miller, our founder, saw how social media and dating apps promised connection but often left people
        feeling more isolated than ever.
        Scrolling through curated likes or swiping through endless profiles, she noticed something was missing: real,
        meaningful human connection.</p>

      <p>Rather than accept that this was “just the way things are,” she imagined something better - a space designed to
        help people truly see and be seen.
        A space where conversations matter more than clicks, and where people connect not for status, but for substance.
      </p>

      <p>That vision became Cubble. Today, it’s a growing global community of people who are choosing depth over
        dopamine and connection over comparison.</p>

    <section class="mission-values">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>


      <p>At Cubble, we’re on a mission to change the way people connect online.</p>

      <p>We are committed to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Putting you in control:</b> Your data belongs to you. Privacy isn’t an afterthought; it’s a foundation.
        </li>
        <li><b>Encouraging real conversations:</b> We prioritize meaningful interactions over mindless scrolling and
          empty metrics.</li>
        <li><b>Creating safe, welcoming spaces:</b> Everyone deserves a supportive environment where they can be their
          authentic self without fear or judgment.</li>
        <li><b>Fighting loneliness:</b> We believe technology should bring people together - not push them further
          apart.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Our mission isn’t just about building a social platform - it’s about helping to rebuild genuine community in a
        digital age.</p>

      <p>Because connection isn’t a luxury. It’s a necessity.</p>
